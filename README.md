Event Sphere Hub is a React-based web app that centralizes university events. Clubs can register, post, and manage events, while students can explore, register, and receive notifications. Built with React, TypeScript, Supabase, and Node.js, it features role-based access, event calendar, and real-time updates. ðŸš€
